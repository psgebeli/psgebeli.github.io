## Summary
Particle physicist/mathematician seeking remote positions in Data Science and Software Development.

## Work Experience
**Belle II Research Assistant, University of MS**  
9/2018 – Present
- Member of Belle II (particle accelerator in Tsukuba, Japan) charm working group aimed at quantifying sources of CP violation in the charm sector.
- Perform several physics analyses on the Belle II dataset, such as undergrad/graduate theses and Ξ0c lifetime measurement.
- Present progress at charm meetings and conferences; review and edit collaboration papers; work data production shifts.
- **Relevant skills**: Python, C/C++, ROOT, PyData Stack, bash, Jupyter, Data Mining, Multivariate Analysis, Boosted Decision Trees, Fitting, Visualization, LATEX, Academic Research, Git, and Confluence.

## Education
- **University of Mississippi, M.S Physics**  
  Expected 5/2024  
  *Thesis title*: TBD. Currently in development; measuring lifetime and branching fractions for various decays of a particular particle, the Ξ+c (charm cascade particle), using the entire Belle II dataset to strengthen existing theoretical predictions and fix inputs used for other $\Xi_c^+$ analyses.

- **University of Mississippi, B.S Physics/Mathematics**  
  5/2022  
  *Thesis title*: Lifetime Measurement of the Ξ+c using Belle II Monte Carlo. [Available to read here](https://egrove.olemiss.edu/hon_thesis/2621/).

## Projects
**B2 Plotter Python Module**  
9/2023
- Python module for easily plotting data and simulations via ROOT and Matplotlib for Belle II analysts.
- Simplifies and accelerates analysis and reduces Python expertise required. [Project page](https://pypi.org/project/b2-plotter/)
- **Relevant skills**: Python, PyPI, Visualization, PyData Stack, Jupyter

**Continuum Neural Network Competition**  
6/2023
- Competition for analysts to develop the highest efficiency tensorflow neural network model for continuum background reduction. [Source code available here](https://github.com/psgebeline/continuum_neural_network). [Competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cshandson/). Efficiency: 95.32% (5th place)
- **Relevant skills**: Python, Visualization, PyData Stack, Binary Classification, TensorFlow, Neural Networks
