## Work Experience
**Belle II Research Assistant, University of MS**  
9/2018 â€“ Present
- Member of Belle II (particle accelerator in Tsukuba, Japan) charm working group aimed at quantifying sources of CP violation in the charm sector.
- Perform several physics analyses on the Belle II dataset, such as undergrad/graduate theses and $\Xi_c^0$ lifetime measurement.
- Present progress at charm meetings and conferences; review and edit collaboration papers; work data production shifts.
- **Relevant skills**: Python, C/C++, ROOT, PyData Stack, bash, Jupyter, Data Mining, Multivariate Analysis, Boosted Decision Trees, Fitting, Visualization, LATEX, Academic Research, Git, and Confluence.

## Education
- **University of Mississippi, M.S Physics**  
  Expected 5/2024  
  *Thesis title*: TBD. Currently in development; measuring lifetime and branching fractions for various decays of a particular particle, the $\Xi_c^+$ (charm cascade particle), using the entire Belle II dataset to strengthen existing theoretical predictions and fix inputs used for other $\Xi_c^+$ analyses.

- **University of Mississippi, B.S Physics/Mathematics**  
  5/2022  
  *Thesis title*: Lifetime Measurement of the $\Xi_c^+$ using Belle II Monte Carlo. [Available to read here](https://egrove.olemiss.edu/hon_thesis/2621/).

## Projects
**B2 Plotter Python Module**  
9/2023
- Python module for easily plotting data and simulations via ROOT and Matplotlib for Belle II analysts.
- Simplifies and accelerates analysis and reduces Python expertise required. [Project page](https://pypi.org/project/b2-plotter/)
- **Relevant skills**: Python, PyPI, Visualization, PyData Stack, Jupyter, Git

**Continuum Classification Neural Network Competition**  
6/2023
- Competition for analysts to develop the highest efficiency tensorflow neural network model for continuum background reduction, primarily using event topology. [Source code available here](https://github.com/psgebeline/continuum_neural_network). [Competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cshandson/). Efficiency: 95.32% (5th place)
- **Relevant skills**: Python, Visualization, PyData Stack, Binary Classification, TensorFlow, Neural Networks, Git

**Tic Tac Toe Minimax AI**
3/2024
- Built a minimax algorithm for Tic-Tac-Toe, along with a pygame interface for the user to play against the AI. I worked on the algorithm, while the script for the pygame interface was provided by the instructor in Harvard's CS50: Introduction to AI course. [Source code](https://github.com/psgebeline/harvard-ML/tree/main/projects/project0/tictactoe)
- **Relevant skills**: Python, Minimax, Git

**Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon**
2/2024
- Used a breadth-first search algorithm to construct a program that can return the number of "degrees" between any two actors; that is, the number of movies that connect them. This is based off of the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, which claims that any actor is connected to Kevin Bacon with less than 6 movies. Completed as part of Harvard's CS50: Introduction to AI course. [Source code](https://github.com/psgebeline/harvard-ML/tree/main/projects/project0/degrees)
- **Relevant skills**: Python, Search Algorithms, Git

**Solar System Simulation**
5/2023
- Created a simulation of the first four planets in our solar system using Pygame; final project for Phys 540: Scientific Computing. [Source code](https://github.com/psgebeline/phys540/tree/main/final)
- **Relevant skills**: Python, Pygame, Visualization, Object-Oriented Programming, Git

**Herbal Remedies**
6/2022
- Submission for My First Game Jam 2022, where we were tasked with creating a game centered around "Healing" in two weeks. Served as software production lead, ensuring each of the four programmers, myself included, were performing necessary tasks within the time limit.
